As you may know, before the STORJ token existed, there was the SJCX token. We moved from using SJCX, a Counterparty asset on the bitcoin blockchain, to STORJ, an ERC20 token, over two years ago. Since then, we’ve allowed token holders to easily convert their SJCX to STORJ via our converter. While there was a bit of activity initially, it has substantially died down since. Starting January 1, 2020, we’ll discontinue conversions completely. This means you must convert your SJCX by Jan. 1, 2020.  So, if you still have SJCX make sure to convert them as soon as possible or you’ll be out of luck … and tokens.
