Our team is a big believer in transparency and openness. We practice radical transparency internally in everything we do, including sharing metrics and data (even when they might not be great), making important decisions openly, and we do not allow for information to be trapped in silos. We're transparent with our community as well. We hold [quarterly town hall meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNq8osZgyMoBr53aMHCYZkvog7JjJt7wm) to share details about the company, we share a [quarterly token report](https://storj.io/blog/categories/token-report) that outlines how we use our STORJ tokens, and we adhere to ethical disclosure methodology about security issues and other vulnerabilities. Ultimately, when we don't have a good reason to not share information, we default to share.

We are also transparent when it comes to compensation. We began our transition to transparent compensation a little over a year ago. We published a detailed plan internally [link to [policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCUOzsZCd_Oyen1_VWsfXUdBr-rXiTt_ySgxJUcuwS8/edit)] last August, and have been tracking the results since. Our intentions in doing so were:

* To remove the mystery around how salary and equity grants are determined
* To enable all team members (and prospective team members) to understand how their compensation was determined 
* To enable all terms members to easily confirm that their comp was determined fairly
* To empower all team members to understand what their compensation could look like at different positions/performance levels
* To make sure our compensation was competitive and consistent with others in our space
* To ensure that we didn't have any bias in compensation based on race, gender, or other factors.

Of course, any move to transparent compensation comes with some concerns. Would it impact our ability to hire and retain great talent? Would it remove our flexibility to reward and incent top performers? Would it be an unintentional hit to morale and impact retention? Would it dramatically increase compensation expense?

One year on, the results appear to be overwhelmingly positive. So, we'd like to share the details of our approach and our initial results.

### Design Criteria

1. **Consistent with Values:** We are an open source company, and three of our core values are togetherness, openness and empowerment. We want to be consistent with all of those values.
2. **Be clear and objective:** The process should be easy to understand and rely as much as possible on third party data and objective criteria.
3. **Respect legitimate differences in compensation:** There are legitimate reasons for people to be compensated differently. Different jobs pay differently. And, within a different job, people perform differently. People who join startups at different stages tend to get different mixes of salary vs equity.
4. **Respect geographic differences:** We are a highly distributed company with people in 28 different cities and 13 different countries. Cost of living, benefits, social programs, and salary markets differ pretty widely across geographies.
5. **Respect privacy:** We want to balance transparency and fairness with individual employees' rights to privacy.
6. **Support overall business objectives:** Like all aspects of people operations, we want to attract and retain top talent, provide proper incentives for great performance, and make sure that our compensation expenses stay in line with a start-up's need to conserve cash and runway.

### Program Elements

The details of the program were shared with the company, and can be found here. A few important elements are summarized below:

1. **Start with third-party data:** We started with data from a well-respected source that consolidates data from hundreds of startups at different stages, and creates target percentiles for salary and equity percentages. The data is presented by job title, showing, for example, what the median and top 75th percentile of similarly situated startups pay as salaries and what percentage of the company they grant as equity.
2. **Be formulaic about minimums and targets:** We created a formula that determined the target compensation for any individual based on their level, their performance, and their location.
3. **Share the rubric:** We made the decision not to publish individual salaries, but publish all of the details that could be used so that any employee could calculate what the target salary and equity would be for any position in the company, in any location, at any performance level.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This included publishing the summary third party data and salary and equity percentages at different percentiles, and the cost of living data for different geographies. It also meant we shared the total number of shares in the company. This enables everyone to easily calculate what they should make and compare it to their actual compensation. It also enabled them to calculate what they would make if they were promoted, changed jobs, changed their performance, etc. We felt this provided a good balance of transparency and privacy. In a remote-first company, it also helps employees understand why they're being compensated in the way they are and how their experience, geographical location, and other factors impact their compensation. 

4. **Adjust up, don't adjust down:** We analyzed where all employees were based on the formula. We adjusted up all employees who were under our targets. However, we did not adjust down employees who were above our targets
5. **Set targets high:** We want to attract top talent. We set salary targets at the 75th percentile. Equity is set at the 50th percentile for all employees, and at the 75th percentile for top-performing employees.
6. **Geographic adjustment:** Salary adjustments are especially important for a remote-first company. To have a highly distributed workforce, it's very important to have location-based flexibility. After all, it would be a challenge to recruit from some areas if you were to pay someone who lives in San Francisco (an area with a high cost of living) the same as someone who lives in Albuquerque (an area with a low cost of living). Our team currently resides across 28 cities and 13 countries, so this is more challenging for us than it might be for others. We use an outside firm to gather specific numbers about the cost of living and salary in different cities and countries versus the US national average. While employees living in countries with very low costs of living may be paid less than their colleagues, we have also set a minimum cap.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critically, while we differentiate pay based off of geography, we don't differentiate stock options. A great engineer in Ukraine gets options representing the same percentage of the company as a great engineer at the same level in San Francisco.

7. **Adjust for Performance:** Last, we leave the ability to adjust salary or equity based on performance. We do reviews every 6 months. During these reviews, employees' performance is evaluated by their managers and peers. We use a 360 approach for reviews to ensure everyone is being evaluated by peers of all levels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an employee is found to be a top performer, they will be compensated higher, generally through equity and not salary.

### Results

#### 1. Retention

We had no regretted departures in the first three months after announcing the program. Over the course of the past year, we've had three regretted departures, or less than 8%, well below the average for companies our size. Of those three, only one departure had compensation as a primary motivator (the others changed to very different roles or started their own companies)

#### 2. Employee perception (quantitative)

We do an anonymous survey on a regular basis, where a broad range of questions are asked, generally on a 5 point scale, where 5 is positive. Employees can optionally identify themselves in terms of ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality.

Some results are presented below.

Overall, our employee net promoter score is above 50, which is world-class. While a lot of factors go into this, the results below do show how compensation is perceived.

Critically, the compensation-related questions are rated very highly, and this appears to align with our overall DEI measures, and appears to be highly correlated with results around eNPS, retention, overall satisfaction, and trust in leadership.

#### 3. Employee perception (qualitative)

Qualitative employee feedback when we announced the policy—and over the intervening year—has been overwhelmingly positive. Employees appreciated the transparency. We've also seen a marked reduction in the vague feelings that some people are treated better than others or that compensation would be radically better at another company. Employees not only like the transparency, but report that they feel better about their compensation.

#### 4. Employee/manager Conversations

We've found this approach has, in addition to creating a more equitable work environment, improved motivation and has resulted in more productive conversations between managers and employees. If an employee wants to earn more, they can easily see what they would make if they were one level higher in their current role. If they are not ranked as a top performer, they can see what would happen to compensation if they were ranked as a top performer. This means that there have been far fewer comp discussions centered on vague perceptions of unfairness or "why does Jane earn more than me?" and far more honest conversations about what employees and their managers need to do to get to the next level. It has also had the unexpected benefit of encouraging technical staff to consider management roles. To be sure, performance and job levels are still more subjective than the other elements that go into compensation. But, this approach focuses the discussion on the right elements.

#### 5. Hiring

This approach has also made hiring easier. We share the data and rubric with prospective hires, and do so early in the recruiting process. We don't need to play negotiating games with prospective hires, and they don't feel the need to play with us. We've seen a marked increase in accepted offers and a marked decrease in job shopping. Almost all new hires have reacted positively to the perception of fairness, and many have turned down higher offers to come to us because they trust the fairness of the process.

#### 6. Expense

After we concluded our initial analysis, we increased total salary expense by about 3.6%, and total employee equity by about 11.5%. While not trivial, these were one time increases. Subsequent salary and equity increases have been in line with increases for companies our size. We strongly believe that improvements in retention, morale, and hiring have far outweighed any increase in expenses.

### Conclusion

For other employers who have considered taking a transparent approach to compensation, I can't recommend it enough. The approach needs to be thoughtful and deliberate. And, it is a lot of work to get right. But, compensation transparency has been an overall win for us in terms of morale, recruiting, trust, productivity, and creating a positive work culture. Even if you're uncertain about incorporating radical transparency into your entire business, consider salary transparency, as it will help your most important asset—your employees—understand their value and know they're treated fairly.
