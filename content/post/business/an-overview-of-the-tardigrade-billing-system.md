We're happy to announce that today we've launched our billing system. The system allows all Tardigrade users to pay for the storage and bandwidth they use on the network. At launch, we're accepting payments via credit card or with STORJ tokens. To view your latest bill, go to the billing tab on your Tardigrade account.

#### Payments Methods and Credits

You can pay for your cloud storage in two ways: credit card and STORJ token---our ERC-20 utility token. If you add both a credit card and a STORJ token balance, your token balance will first be utilized, followed by your credit card. If you have an account credit, that will also be utilized before charging your credit card.

During pre-production, once you add a payment method, we will give you a credit of $55 and increase your limits to 1TB for both bandwidth and static storage. The $55 credit is the equivalent of 1TB of storage and 1TB of bandwidth and expires at the end of the first full billing cycle after production. If you've already signed up, you can claim your credit by simply adding a credit card or at least $50 worth of STORJ tokens in one single transaction.

#### Payment Methods and Rate Limits

Every Tardigrade account has a rate limit, which limits how much data a user can upload to the network and how much bandwidth they can utilize during any billing period. These limits are on a per-Satellite basis. So if you have a 1TB limit for storage and bandwidth on three Satellites, you have a total of 3TBs across all Satellites.

All limits are set to zero until a method of payment is added. Once a method of payment is added, the limits will default to 1TB during pre-production and 5GB after our general availability production launch. (So create your Tardigrade account and add a method of payment now to get access to these higher limits.) If you would like to increase your limits, you can always [contact our support team through the Tardigrade support portal](https://support.tardigrade.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000683212&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=tar%2Bbilling%2Boverview).

#### Documentation

Really, billing is quite straightforward, however our team has put together detailed documentation that answers all the finer questions about the Tardigrade billing system.
